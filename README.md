Probabilistic Modeling of Ride-Hailing Demand
Introduction:

This project demonstrates how probability and statistics can be applied to model and analyze real-world demand behavior. It simulates hourly ride requests and acceptance decisions using probabilistic distributions and visualizes uncertainty in the system.

Problem Statement:

A ride-hailing platform wants to understand how many ride requests occur per hour in order to optimize driver availability and reduce customer wait time.

Approach

Poisson Distribution is used to model the number of ride requests per hour.

Bernoulli Distribution is used to model accept/reject decisions for each request.

Statistical analysis and visualization are used to study demand variation and uncertainty.

Tools & Libraries:

Python

NumPy

Pandas

SciPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Bokeh

Key Learnings:
