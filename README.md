🚕Probabilistic Modeling of Ride-Hailing Demand
Introduction:

This project demonstrates how probability and statistics can be applied to model and analyze real-world demand behavior. It simulates hourly ride requests and acceptance decisions using probabilistic distributions and visualizes uncertainty in the system.

🎯Problem Statement:

A ride-hailing platform wants to understand how many ride requests occur per hour in order to optimize driver availability and reduce customer wait time.

📊Approach:

1️⃣Poisson Distribution is used to model the number of ride requests per hour.

2️⃣Bernoulli Distribution is used to model accept/reject decisions for each request.


🛠️Tools & Libraries:
